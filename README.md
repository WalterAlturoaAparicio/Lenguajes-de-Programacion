I am a student of Software Development in the second semester, and in this workspace I will upload the works that are necessary as university jobs of Programming languages subject and other subjects, and also as CV just in case. 
I have done some projects with my colleagues that I will also upload, among them is an application for a dentistry, and a pet store.
